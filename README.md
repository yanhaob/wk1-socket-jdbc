Task1 is to design a p2p chatbox based on Socket, requiring that sessions can be established through any common port within the same gateway, and socket communication and two-way text sending& receiving can be performed. Task2 is to migrate SQL CRUD instructions to JDBC implementation.

## Socket
cd p2pchat/src, run yanhaoServer.java, yanhaoClient.java, as followed by the Fig.1 below.
